The doxygen module allow to create links to a Doxygen documentation. As
Doxygen does not specify the the type of connector between namespace
and items, you have to specify it between parentheses. If not specified,
the default is a single ".". A reference can also be specificied if the
code documentation is accessible in a different directory as the directory
containing the tag file.

You have simply to put a hash ## in front of a class: #(bsim::BoardView).

A class names, specially in C++, may be too long, you can specify prefixes
to look for.

@doxy-prefix bsim::

And now, you don't have to specify the full name: #BoardView.

But the usual notation is still working: #(bsim::AbstractRegisterNode).
