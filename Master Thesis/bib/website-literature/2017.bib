  abstract  = {In semiconductor industry it is necessary to test devices at different electro-thermal load conditions
in order to detect possible weaknesses in design and functionality as soon as possible. To reduce
the testing time, often accelerated stress tests are used. The repetitive applied stress during
accelerated lifetime tests causes visible signs of damage in the devices, which in the worst case
triggers device failure. The focus of this work lies in the description of the damage propagation
in a metal layer of interest by means of scanning acoustic microscopy images. To automatically
quantify and measure the damage in these images, two image processing algorithms are developed.
For this purpose, the image processing software ImageJ is used. The algorithms can be applied
on different types of devices providing robust and easily interpretable results.

To model the amount of the damaged area in the metal layer dependent on the load condition,
beta regression models are applied. For the development of the model, the betareg package of
the statistical program R is used. In this work, two types of beta regression models are considered.
The so-called basic beta regression model models the mean of the response, but assumes a
constant precision parameter. The so-called variable dispersion model models both, the mean
and the precision parameter. Different model set ups are compared based on goodness-of-fit
criteria, where in the end the variable dispersion model is chosen as it provides the most accurate
results.

The results show that the information about the damage in the metal layer extracted from the
scanning acoustic microscopy images by image processing techniques is physically plausible. It
can be modeled with a beta regression model based on a physically meaningful set of covariates
and also predictions for a new set of images can be made.

  abstract  = {To ensure maximum reliability while keeping low production costs,
	the semiconductor fabrication process has to be flawless. One method
	to accomplish this task is testing each manufactured device. In the
	testing procedure predefined performance specifications are given.
	Devices which do not match these specifications are not further processed.
	The  testing is done with the Automated Testing Equipment. This system
	induces electrical signals to the device to examine if the required
	performance is within the specification limits. If a device exceeds
	these limits it is labeled as a fail, otherwise it is called pass.

	The focus of this thesis is the identification and characterization
	of so-called test patterns which emerge from systemic misclassifications
	of devices due to malfunction of the testing equipment.

	In order to accomplish this task, a measure is created, identifying
	possible present test patterns. Therefore, the autocovariance function
	of a weakly stationary stochastic process together with the Shannon
	entropy is used.

	The whole procedure is summarized in an algorithm called TePEx. The
	programming environment used for the implementation of the algorithm
	is R.  Further, a user friendly software application is build with
	the R extension package Shiny, to allow non R programmers to visualize
	the data and to use the TePEx algorithm.

	A data investigation confirms that TePEx provides reliable results
	to identify and characterize test patterns.},

However, occasional reports on irregularities during recovery have been published. We will show here that - consistent with a gate-sided hydrogen release mechanism - additional degradation can apparently build-up during recovery also after BTI stress, which can under certain circumstances even exceed the post-stress degradation levels. This additional degradation may invalidate existing lifetime extrapolation methods and must therefore be carefully understood. Our results demonstrate that although post-stress degradation build-up is only visible under certain conditions, it is an essential feature of BTI and thus provides important clues on its microscopic origin.},

Our results indicate that GaN:C does not behave like a classical semiconductor but is rather determined by a defect band (DB). Leakage via DB is the slowest process in charging/discharging dynamics, thus controlling it. We propose a microscopic model of carrier exchange between the carbon atom and the DB which can also explain the wide range of activation energies attributed previously to carbon. Understanding of leakage mechanisms and its interplay with charging is an important step towards optimization of GaN HEMT buffers.},

MOSFETs produced on the a-face show a higher electron mobility than Si-face devices, although their charge pumping signal is 5 times higher, indicating a higher interface/border trap density. We show the main contribution to the interface/border trap density on a-face devices originates from deep states in a wide range around midgap, whereas Si-face devices show a higher and exponentially increasing interface/border state density close to the conduction band edge of 4H silicon carbide, resulting in reduced mobility.},
