  abstract  = {In current automotive technology, Smart power devices are used for different applications where switching, protection, diagnostic and power control functions must be implemented. Smart power switches are used in applications to switch devices like an incandescent bulb,
engine starter, power window, fans or electrical water/gasoline pumps. The dynamic load emulation module is designed for stress testing of Smart power devices under automotive load conditions. The main reason to use dynamic load emulation instead of actual loads
(i.e. motors, bulbs) is to provide flexible and programmable behavioral models that behave similarly to real load devices. Dynamic load emulation models allow for the change of parameters on the fly and the execution of non-destructive testing under controlled and repeatable conditions. A hardware prototype is built and a model with behavior similar to real lamp loads is implemented. An appropriate model is provided based on literature research and previous investigations. The correct parameters for this electrical lamp model are taken from investigation and simulation of real lamps which are provided by Infineon Technologies. The electrical model requires more effort than using a real incandescent bulb, but in the end, the load emulation module provides a faster electrical and thermal response, therefore allowing test acceleration for end of life testing. The
module also provides direct measurement and diagnosis options due to accessibility and availability of all electrical signals. The flexibility of the system is another key advantage, providing the possibility to easily change all parameters of the emulated load behavior in a programmable way, instead of manually changing the real load devices.},
