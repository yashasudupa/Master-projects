  abstract  = {The effect of residual inorganic elements on the local plastic deformation behaviour of two different copper films was investigated. It was found that a film containing inorganic elements in the ppm range, has a distinctively higher hardness at twin boundaries and high angle grain boundaries compared to the grain interior. An almost pure copper film shows no distinct difference regarding the plastic deformation compared to the same microstructural features. The results suggest that such residual elements form hard boundaries, leading to higher hardness on a local microstructural level. Moreover, the influence of the local topography was demonstrated. The use of atomic force microscopy before and after indentation illustrated that significant errors in the determination of hardness occurs when the local surface topography matches the dimensions of the indenter tip.
This was further confirmed by the quantitative comparison of the elastic properties of the loading and unloading segments of the corresponding load-depth curves using Hertzian contact mechanics and the Oliver-Pharr method. It is demonstrated that the measured hardness values can be directly correlated to local microstructural and topography features.},

  abstract  = {We study the subthreshold drain current hysteresis of 4H silicon carbide Si-face (0001) and a-face (11-20) n-channel power MOSFETs between gate voltage sweeps from accumulation to inversion and vice versa. Depending on the direction of the gate voltage sweep, the MOSFETs show a different subthreshold drain current at the same gate voltage. The observed hysteresis between up-sweep and down-sweep can be expressed as a subthreshold voltage shift and may reach several volts. We show that the voltage shift is caused by hole capture in border traps during accumulation and is directly propotional to the charge pumping signal. The voltage shift is fully recoverable by applying a gate bias above the threshold voltage and does not impact device reliability.},

This paper presents a modular test system architecture which focuses on flexibility, reusability and adaptability to future test requirements. Different types of tests for different devices in application circuit configuration can be implemented based on the same modular test system concept. Vital parameters of the device under test (DUT) can be acquired in situ during the running stress test. This enables to collect drift data of this parameters. The control and data acquisition parts of the test system are separated from the actual test circuit. With this physical separation, the same control part can be used for different types of tests. Experimental results of a prototype test system are provided.},
