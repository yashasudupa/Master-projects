The NO POA causes a decrease in overall ∆Vth for longer NO POA times and higher NO POA temperatures. As opposed to the change in ∆Vth , the device Ron increases with NO POA temperature and time.},

  abstract  = {We study the threshold voltage (Vth) instability of commercially available silicon carbide (SiC) power MOSFETs or prototypes from four different manufacturers under positive bias temperature stress (PBTS). A positive bias near the Vth causes a threshold voltage shift of 0.7 mV per decade in time per nanometer oxide thickness in the temperature range between-50 °C and 150 °C. Recovery at +5 V after a 100 s +25 V gate-pulse causes a recovery between-1.5 mV/dec/nm and-1.0 mV/dec/nm at room temperature and is decreasing with temperature. All devices show similar stress, recovery and temperature dependent behavior indicating that the observed Vth instabilities are likely a fundamental physical property of the SiC-SiO2 system caused by electron trapping in near interface traps. It is important to note that the trapping is not causing permanent damage to the interface like H-bond-breakage in silicon based devices and is nearly fully reversible via a negative gate bias.},

  abstract  = {Charge trapping phenomena at interfaces of GaN-based semiconductors with a dielectric are one of the major concerns in modern MIS-HEMT technologies. Fundamental questions about the nature and the behavior of interface defects must still be answered. We address these questions by investigating devices with and without an AlGaN layer at the the interface with the dielectric, using MIS capacitor test structures. We consider different methodologies to perform and analyze impedance measurements and the results are compared and discussed. Special attention is paid to the uncertainties and limitations inherent to different techniques, as well as the challenges due to the composite structure of GaN/AlGaN devices. We introduce an on the fly technique which allows the extraction of the device drift during stress. This enables us to suggest a lower and upper boundary for the amount of device degradation. The experimental results indicate the presence of similar defects at GaN and AlGaN surfaces, which therefore appear to be intrinsic to the III-N material.},
