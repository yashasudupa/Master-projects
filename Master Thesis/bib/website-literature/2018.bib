  abstract  = {Electrical measurement of degradation in metal films induced by high thermo-mechanical stress is not possible. Therefore, different imaging methods are used in practice to visualize the changes in material microstructure. In this work, SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) cross section images of the metal layer of interest that illustrate the fatigue induced degradation and material microstructure are analyzed. We propose an unsupervised algorithm for detection and quantitative assessment of the damage in mentioned images. In the first stage of the algorithm, the metal layer of interest is extracted from the background using k-Means method. In the second stage, the non-local means (NL-means) denoising method with automatically computed standard noise deviation followed by post-processing and k-Means is used to detect the damage patterns. Visual and quantitative evaluation of results reveals that the algorithm provides robust and plausible results.},

These methods focus mostly on determining the time-dependence of the threshold voltage shift. Other experimental methods able to resolve the energetic distribution of traps in the bandgap have recently not been as frequently employed as they introduce a large delay and also require switching the device into accumulation, which considerably accelerates recovery. Here we use detailed CV measurements to study NBTI/PBTI in SiO2 nMOS/pMOS capacitors. We extract a unique defect band inside the SiO2 insulator which can describe the build-up of near-interfacial states over time in all four combinations using our recently suggested gate-sided hydrogen release model. Our results suggest that depending on the transistor type and stress bias conditions, the generated slowly-recovering near-interfacial states are due to a combination of slower oxide traps and faster Pb centers.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Understanding the microscopic structure of the SiC/SiO2 interface is crucial for the improvement of SiC based metal‐oxide‐semiconductor field‐effect transistors (MOSFETs). It is well established that interface states degrade the performance and reliability of SiC MOSFETs and that passivation can be achieved by anneals in NO‐containing atmospheres. However, the structural changes associated with the NO anneal and the improvement of the channel electron mobility are still not fully understood. In this study, the SiC/SiO2 interface of the state‐of‐the art 4H‐SiC n‐channel MOSFETs with a deposited oxide is extensively investigated with advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and spatially resolved electron energy‐loss spectroscopy (EELS) methods. The samples are treated with different postoxidation anneals (NO vs O2), resulting in strongly differing mobility and point defect density. The most notable structural difference between the samples is an increased N concentration located in the transition region between the SiC and the SiO2 of the NO‐annealed sample. The N signal is evenly distributed along the whole faceted interface and has a half‐width of wN = (1.8 ± 0.7) nm and an estimated areal density of cN = (4 ± 1) × 1014 cm−2. The observations support the idea that the N incorporation happens predominantly directly at the SiC/SiO2 interface where defect states are passivated.},

  abstract  = {When using JEDEC-like measurement patterns, MOSFETs based on 4H-SiC show amplified voltage shifts during gate bias stress compared to their silicon-based counterparts. We show that the majority of the extracted voltage shift originates from fully reversible components and strongly relies on stress-independent measurement conditions such as the reference point for the calculation of the voltage shift and timing parameters. An enhanced bias temperature instability measurement technique using device preconditioning is presented and compared to standard JEDEC-like measurement patterns developed for bias temperature instability evaluation of silicon MOSFETs. We show that preconditioned measurements allow for accurate and nearly delay and recovery time independent extraction of the permanent component within typical industrial timescales.},
