  abstract  = {We employed the thermal dielectric relaxation current method (TDRC) for the cryogenic characterization of ammonia (NH3) post oxidation annealed 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) trench MOSFETs. We studied differences and similarities between annealing in nitric oxide (NO) and NH3. In NO and NH3 annealed trench MOSFETs, the same type of traps was found near the conduction band edge of 4H-SiC. The TDRC-signal consists of two peaks caused by interface states with a thermal emission barrier of 0.13 eV and near interface traps (NITs) with an emission barrier of approximately 0.3 eV. Significantly more interface traps close to the conduction band edge were found for the NH3 annealed devices compared to the NO annealed ones. Our TDRC results indicate that NH3 post oxidation anneal (POA) affects trap levels in a different way than NO POA.},

  abstract  = {Hard switching of semiconductors are the main source of conducted electromagnetic emissions (EME) in pulse-width modulation (PWM) driven power inverters. The requirements on the electromagnetic compatibility grow with the increasing number of installed electric motor drives and inductive power converters. An accurate pre¬diction of the conducted EME requires a model which considers the switching tran¬sition of the power semiconductors and the parasitic elements. This typically leads to complex SPICE models, which are hardly suitable for fast dynamic simulations and a model-based controller design. This paper presents a compact mathematical model of a low voltage half-bridge inverter, which is based on large-signal models for the individual components and allows for the fast simulation of the conducted EME and switching losses. The high accuracy of the proposed mathematical model is demonstrated by measurement results. In particular, it is shown that the model is able to accurately predict the conducted electromagnetic emissions up to 100 MHz.},

  abstract  = {The active control of the current slew rate of hard switched voltage source inverters is a common method to reduce the electromagnetic emissions, overshoot and ringing. In a previous publication, the authors proposed a model-based optimal slew rate control strategy which combines iterative learning control (ILC) with an adaptive feedforward control for a single half-bridge inverter. This control strategy minimizes the switching losses while the current slew rate stays within desired limits. This paper presents the required extensions of the current slew rate control strategy for a three-phase voltage source inverter driving a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). The extended control strategy is implemented on a rapid prototype test bench to verify the performance by a number of measurement results. The results show that the current slew rate of each phase is controlled separately within the defined limits while the switching losses are minimized, independent of the load current, the supply voltage and the temperature.},

  abstract  = {A faulty device can lead to errors in a system. Manufacturers are using modern test methods to detect such components in time and eliminate them from the production process. Sufficiently high test coverage, implying less defective parts per million (DFFM), can often only be achieved with suitable additional design-for-test (DfT) measures. The aim of this thesis work is to characterize the existing test methodology in terms of test coverage and to quantify the test coverage. For analog circuits, there is no defined standard for fault simulation in order to define the Test coverage. This work defines the fault model for fault simulation.These fault models are investigated and their effectiveness is presented for analog fault simulation. Test concepts from the Automatic Testing Equipment (ATE) are analysed and based on them, a testbench is designed in the simulation environment. The translation method for ATE program to simulation environment has been defined for simpler and faster translation. A tool from cadence is used to automate parts of the fault simulation. The results are analysed and the undetected faults are identified in the circuit. Signal path analysis allowed to detect a few of the undetected faults. This led to improved test coverage by including additional tests to detect the previously undetected faults. This shall help improve ATE test quality leading to improved test coverage and reliability. This will also facilitate the development of automatic test pattern generator (ATPG) and automatic DfT Implementation for analog circuits.},

  abstract  = {Stress and recovery dynamics of the drain current are analysed in normally-off GaN Hybrid-Drain - embedded Gate Injection Transistors (HD-GITs) submitted to a semi-ON state stress. Under this condition moderate drain current and high drain voltage (350-650 V) are applied simultaneously. During the stress phase the drain current shows a remarkable decrease due to hot carrier trapping and is dependent on the applied drain voltage, stress current and temperature (30–190 °C). This degradation is fully recoverable, either thermally in the temperature range 150–190 °C or by hole injection from the gate. We provide a model for the detrapping time constant taking into account both the thermally-driven process dominating for gate biases VGS < 3 V and hole capture dominant for VGS > 3 V.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, a computational framework, which enables efficient and robust parameter identification, as well as uncertainty quantification in state space models based on Itô stochastic processes, is presented. For optimization, a Maximum Likelihood approach based on the system's corresponding Fokker-Planck equation is followed. Gradient information is included by means of an adjoint approach, which is based on the Lagrangian of the optimization problem. To quantify the uncertainty of the Maximum-A-Posteriori estimates of the model parameters, a Bayesian inference approach based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, as well as profile likelihoods are implemented and compared in terms of runtime and accuracy. The framework is applied to experimental electron backscatter diffraction data of a fatigued metal film, where the aim is to develop a model, which consistently and physically meaningfully captures the metal's microstructural changes that are caused by external loading.},

  abstract  = {New applications such as renewable energy sources demand reliable operating lifetimes beyond 15 years. To validate the robustness of power semiconductors, it is paramount to investigate the effects and interactions of various failure and degradation mechanisms. In particular, the degradation of power semiconductors under application relevant stress test conditions until their end-of-life is of interest. The difficulties with such application relevant end-of-life testing is that test systems are very complex and costly. In addition, it is difficult to protect the devices under test sufficiently for post failure analysis without interfering too much with the operation itself. This paper presents a modular test system that can be configured to apply different operating scenarios and apply application relevant stress to the devices under test. Within the presented system, numerous safety features have been implemented to minimize the damage to a failed device under test so that it may undergo further analysis. By making applications relevant stress testing feasible and capable of end-of-life testing, we hope to contribute to making future power electronic system more reliable.},
