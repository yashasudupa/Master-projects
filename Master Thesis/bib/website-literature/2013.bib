Reliability tests are performed with components soldered on test substrates under defined test conditions. The components are mostly smart power switches (SPS).
In order to define the test parameters even better and more efficiently, the use of intelligent test substrates is planned in future. These substrates should be designed for reliable operation under Automotive stress test conditions.
This bachelor thesis is concerned with the implementation of the firmware for the intelligent test substrate which was developed in my first bachelor thesis.},
