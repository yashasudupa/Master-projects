  abstract  = {Increasing stress in modern engine management systems utilizes integrated circuits up to their thermal and electrical limits. To qualify the reliability of Smart power switches in short circuit condition, the Kompetenzzentrum für Automobil- und Industrieelektronik (KAI) GmbH runs active cycle test systems according to AEC standard Q100-012. Smart power switches have several integrated protection mechanisms. To verify the performance of these functions and to compare new technology features, advanced measurement and test sys-tems are required.
The aim of this master thesis is to develop a new hardware control and meas-urement interface for the available test systems to provide more and advanced features. It will be considered, how accurately the required voltage/current range can be digitized. A differential voltage measurement for 16 measure-ments channels should be implemented, to sample every device under test in the test system. The whole hardware interface will be digitally controlled. This leads to the necessity to develop an address bus structure, which deals with the large amount of digital signal channels and enables high speed measurement data transfer.},
