  abstract  = {The availability of small inexpensive sensor elements enables the employment of large wired or wireless sensor networks for feeding control systems. Unfortunately, the need to transmit a large number of sensor measurements over a network negatively affects the timing parameters of the control loop. This paper presents a solution to this problem by representing sensor measurements with an approximate representation --- an interpolation of sensor measurements as a function of space coordinates. A priority-based medium access control (MAC) protocol is used to select the sensor messages with high information content. Thus, the information from a large number of sensor measurements is conveyed within a few messages. This approach greatly reduces the time for obtaining a snapshot of the environment state and therefore supports the real-time requirements of feedback control loops.},

This new edition retains the original objective and philosophy of focusing on the fundamental principles, models, and technical requirements needed for designing practical power electronic systems while adding a wealth of new material.
Improved features of this new edition include:

 A new chapter on input filters, showing how to design single and multiple section filters;
 Major revisions of material on averaged switch modeling, low-harmonic rectifiers, and the chapter on AC modeling of the discontinuous conduction mode;
 New material on soft switching, active-clamp snubbers, zero-voltage transition full-bridge converter, and auxiliary resonant commutated pole. Also, new sections on design of multiple-winding magnetic and resonant inverter design;
 Additional appendices on Computer Simulation of Converters using averaged switch modeling, and Middlebrook's Extra Element Theorem, including four tutorial examples; and
 Expanded treatment of current programmed control with complete results for basic converters, and much more.

This edition includes many new examples, illustrations, and exercises to guide students and professionals through the intricacies of power electronics design.
Fundamentals of Power Electronics, Second Edition, is intended for use in introductory power electronics courses and related fields for both senior undergraduates and first-year graduate students interested in converter circuits and electronics, control systems, and magnetic and power systems. It will also be an invaluable reference for professionals working in power electronics, power conversion, and analog and digital electronics.},

  abstract  = {Traditionally, the 4–20 mA analog signal used in industry to interface sensors in distributed process control has been replaced with relatively simple digital networks, called “field-buses”, and recently by Ethernet. In this work, three interfaces for a simple sensor, based on the same architecture and microcontroller, have been implemented and tested: Profibus-DP, CANbus2.0B and Ethernet IEEE802.3. The experimental results show that the Ethernet interface, although less efficient than field-bus interfaces, requires about the same resources, in terms of computing power and memory space for code and data storage. As an Internet-capable sensor could be virtually reached from everywhere, for remote control and diagnosis, the feasibility of an Internet interface has been investigated. A full-compliant implementation of high-level protocols as TCP/IP or HTTP needs many resources to be implemented, resulting too expensive for a “smart sensor”. For this reason, a simple UDP-based solution, that preserves Internet visibility, has been proposed and implemented. Obtained results match with a low-cost smart Internet-sensor.},

  abstract      = {Steering traffic in cities is a very complex task, since improving efficiency involves the coordination of many actors. Traditional approaches attempt to optimize traffic lights for a particular density and configuration of traffic. The disadvantage of this lies in the fact that traffic densities and configurations change constantly. Traffic seems to be an adaptation problem rather than an optimization problem. We propose a simple and feasible alternative, in which traffic lights self-organize to improve traffic flow. We use a multi-agent simulation to study three self-organizing methods, which are able to outperform traditional rigid and adaptive methods. Using simple rules and no direct communication, traffic lights are able to self-organize and adapt to changing traffic conditions, reducing waiting times, number of stopped cars, and increasing average speeds.},

  abstract      = {Summary: Traffic light coordination is a complex problem. In this paper, we extend previous work on an abstract model of city traffic to allow for multiple street intersections. We test a self-organizing method in our model, showing that it is close to theoretical optima and superior to a traditional method of traffic light coordination. Abstract: The elementary cellular automaton following rule 184 can mimic particles flowing in one direction at a constant speed. This automaton can therefore model highway traffic. In a recent paper, we have incorporated intersections regulated by traffic lights to this model using exclusively elementary cellular automata. In such a paper, however, we only explored a rectangular grid. We now extend our model to more complex scenarios employing an hexagonal grid. This extension shows first that our model can readily incorporate multiple-way intersections and hence simulate complex scenarios. In addition, the current extension allows us to study and evaluate the behavior of two different kinds of traffic light controller for a grid of six-way streets allowing for either two or three street intersections: a traffic light that tries to adapt to the amount of traffic (which results in self-organizing traffic lights) and a system of synchronized traffic lights with coordinated rigid periods (sometimes called the "green wave" method). We observe a tradeoff between system capacity and topological complexity. The green wave method is unable to cope with the complexity of a higher-capacity scenario, while the self-organizing method is scalable, adapting to the complexity of a scenario and exploiting its maximum capacity. Additionally, in this paper we propose a benchmark, independent of methods and models, to measure the performance of a traffic light controller comparing it against a theoretical optimum.},

Although emerging high voltage AlGaN/GaN HEMT technologies have shown switching advantages, the short-circuit performance has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present an experimental study and numerical simulation analysis of 650V AlGaN/GaN HEMTs short-circuit safe-operating-area (SCSOA), and provide a theory for the reduction in ruggedness at high voltage short circuit conditions.},

  abstract     = {Ethernet local area network operation is specified for selected speeds of operation from 1 Mb/s to 100 Gb/s using a common media access control (MAC) specification and management information base (MIB). The Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) MAC protocol specifies shared medium (half duplex) operation, as well as full duplex operation. Speed specific Media Independent Interfaces (MIIs) allow use of selected Physical Layer devices (PHY) for operation over coaxial, twisted-pair or fiber optic cables. System considerations for multisegment shared access networks describe the use of Repeaters that are defined for operational speeds up to 1000 Mb/s. Local Area Network (LAN) operation is supported at all speeds. Other specified capabilities include various PHY types for access networks, PHYs suitable for metropolitan area network applications, and the provision of power over selected twisted-pair PHY types.},

First a summary of current hierarchical operations is given, together with an assessment of the underlying assumptions. Next, the challenge of operating electric power systems over very broad ranges of system conditions is presented as an open sensing, estimation, and control problem. The latter part of this paper is motivated by fundamental technological and organizational changes. These are requiring a shift from hierarchical to multilayered open access modeling, monitoring, and control paradigms for large complex electric power systems. A vision of a novel information-based multilayered dynamic energy control protocols (DECPs) framework for facilitating evolution into open access just-in-time (JIT) and just-in-place (JIP) electricity services of the future is presented.},

  abstract  = {Current collapse at high drain voltage in a GaN-based transistor is successfully suppressed by the introduction of p-GaN region which is placed beside the drain of a Gate Injection Transistor (GIT). The additional p-GaN region enables hole injection which effectively releases trapped electrons at around drain region after the application of high drain voltages. The p-GaN region is electrically connected to the drain electrode so that this is named as Hybrid Drain-embedded GIT (HD-GIT). The fabricated HD-GITs are free from current collapse at 850 V of the drain voltage or over, which significantly helps to achieve stable system operations and is very promising for future switching power supply applications.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, approaches to control performance and resource optimization for embedded control systems have been receiving increased attention. Most of them focus on theory, whereas practical aspects are omitted. Theoretical advances demand flexible real-time kernel support for multitasking and preemption, thus requiring more sophisticated and expensive software/hardware solutions. On the other hand, embedded control systems often have cost constraints related with mass production and strong industrial competition, thus demanding low-cost solutions. In this paper, it is shown that these conflicting demands can be softened and that a compromise solution can be reached. We advocate that recent research results on optimal resource management for control tasks can be implemented on simple multitasking preemptive real-time kernels targeting low-cost microprocessors, which can be easily built in-house and tailored to actual application needs. The experimental evaluation shows that significant control performance improvement can be achieved without increasing hardware costs.},

Simulation is an important research method therein, as it helps to avoid costly failures. A common smart grid simulation platform is still missing. We introduce a conceptual model of agents in multiple flow networks. Flow networks extend the depth of established power flow analysis through use of networks of information flow and financial transactions. We use this model as a basis for comparing different power system simulators. Furthermore, a quantitative comparison of simulators is done to facilitate the decision for a suitable tool in comprehensive smart grid simulation.},

  abstract  = {The knowledge of program execution times is crucial for the development and the verification of real-time software. Therefore, there is a need for methods and tools to predict the timing behavior of pieces of program code and entire programs. This paper presents a novel method for the analysis of program execution times. The computation of MAximum eXecution Times (MAXTs) is mapped onto a graph-theoretical problem that is a generalization of the computation of a maximum cost circulation in a directed graph. Programs are represented by T-graphs, timing graphs, which are similar to flow graphs. These graphs reflect the structure and the timing behavior of the code. Relative capacity constraints, a generalization of capacity constraints that bound the flow in the edges, express user-supplied information about infeasible paths. To compute MAXTs, T-graphs are searched for those execution paths which correspond to a maximum cost circulation. The search problem is transformed into an integer linear programming problem. The solution of the linear programming problem yields the MAXT. The special merits of the presented method are threefold: It uses a concise notation to characterize the static structure of a program and its possible execution paths. Furthermore, the notation allows for a description of the feasible paths through the program code that characterizes the behavior of the code sufficiently to compute the exact maximum execution time of the program – not just a bound thereof. Finally, linear program solving does not only yield maximum execution times, but also produces detailed information about the execution time and the number of executions of every single program construct in the worst case. This knowledge is valuable for a more comprehensive analysis of the timing of a program.},

Constant on or off-time converters in continuous conduction mode (CCM) have two complex right-half-plane (RHP) zeros in the current loop feedback, but reduced modulator gain eliminates current-loop instability. The modulator gain exhibits a frequency-dependent phase which introduces an extra gain term in the circuit model. The new model for DCM operation does not have RHP zeros in the current feedback loop, but the buck converter exhibits an instability for higher conversion ratios.<>},

Using a simple pole-zero transfer function, the model is able to predict subharmonic oscillation without the need for discrete-time z-transform models. The accuracy of sampled-data modeling is incorporated into the model by a second-order representation of the sampled-data transfer function which is valid up to half the switching frequency. Predictions of current loop gain; control-to-output; output impedance; and audio susceptibility transfer functions were confirmed with measurements on a buck converter. The audio susceptibility of the buck converter can be nulled with the appropriate value of external ramp. The modeling concentrates on constant-frequency pulse-width modulation (PWM) converters, but the methods can be applied to variable-frequency control and discontinuous conduction mode},

  abstract      = {Many of the current bio-inspired delivery networks set their focus on search, e.g., by using artificial ants. If the network size and, therefore, the search space gets too large, the users experience high delays until the requested content can be consumed. In previous work, we proposed different replication strategies to reduce the search space. In this report we further evaluate measures for storage load balancing, because peers are most likely limited in space. We periodically apply clean-ups if a certain storage level is reached. For our evaluations we combine the already introduced replication measures with least recently used (LRU), least frequently used (LFU) and a hormone-based clean-up. The goal is to elaborate a combination that leads to low delays while the replica utilization is high.},

One of the perceived drawbacks to CAN has been the inability to bound accurately the worst-case response time of a given message (i.e., the longest time between queueing the message and the message arriving at the destination processors). This paper presents an analysis to bound such latencies. A benchmark is used to illustrate the application of this analysis.},

  abstract  = {The development of high-performance power devices is increasingly supported by predictive computer simulations on the basis of well-calibrated physical device models. Today's challenge is to make virtual experiments and tests on the computer, which are qualitatively reliable and quantitatively accurate even for device structures that have never been built before, and under operational conditions that very rarely occur as long as the device is kept within the {\textquotedblleft}safe operating area (SOA){\textquotedblright}. What we are interested in is to explore the rim of the SOA and even to go beyond it in order to study failure and, eventually, destruction mechanisms with a view to improving robustness and reliability of the devices. In particular in the field of high power electronics, predictive high-fidelity computer simulations of {\textquotedblleft}virtual desctruction{\textquotedblright} are of utmost importance. We will illustrate today's state of the art with reference to selected real-life examples.},

From capacitor users' viewpoint, this paper presents a review on the improvement of reliability of dc link in power electronic converters from two aspects: 1) reliability-oriented dc-link design solutions; 2) conditioning monitoring of dc-link capacitors during operation. Failure mechanisms, failure modes and lifetime models of capacitors suitable for the applications are also discussed as a basis to understand the physics-of-failure. This review serves to provide a clear picture of the state-of-the-art research in this area and to identify the corresponding challenges and future research directions for capacitors and their dc-link applications.},

  abstract      = {Individual cellular automata rules are attractive models for a range of biological and physical self-assembling systems. While coexpression and coevolution are common in such systems, ensembles of cellular automata rules remain poorly understood. Here we report the first known analysis of the equally weighted ensemble of all elementary cellular automata (ECA) rules. Ensemble dynamics reveal persistent, localized, non-interacting patterns, rather than homogenization. The patterns are strongly correlated by velocity and have a quasi-linear dependence on initial conditions. Dispersion from a single initial site generates peaks traveling at low-denominator fractional velocities, some of which are not discernible in individual rules, suggesting collective excitation. Further analysis of the time-evolved rule space shows the 256 ECA rules can be represented by only approximately 111 principal components. These results suggest the rather surprising conclusion that rich self-assembly is possible without favoring particular local interactions.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes an isolated quasi-switched-capacitor (QSC) dc/dc converter to serve as an auxiliary power supply in electric and hybrid electric vehicles, managing a bidirectional power flow between the high-voltage (HV) battery and the low-voltage dc bus. A QSC dc/ac circuit with a 3:1 voltage step-down ratio is proposed to serve as the front-stage circuit of the converter. Based on it, an isolated QSC dc/dc converter is proposed with a synchronous-rectifier, current-doubler post-stage circuit. Compared with existing full-bridge, half-bridge, and three-level converters, the features of the proposed converter include: 1) the voltage stresses on HV-side switches are reduced to two-third of the HV-dc-bus voltage; 2) the voltage stress on transformer is reduced to one-third of the HV-dc-bus voltage; 3) the transformer turns ratio is reduced; 4) it has soft-switching capability and high efficiency; and 5) bidirectional power-flow and simple control can be implemented. The operation principles, soft-switching analysis, and simulation results are presented. Wide Bandgap devices are selected for the proposed converter to shrink the size of passive components, provide high efficiency, and decrease the cooling requirement. Guidelines are given to estimate the key circuit parameters, including the capacitance of the switched capacitors, the transformer dc-bias flux density, and the average currents of the post-stage inductors. Experiment results provided from a 1-kW prototype built with SiC MOSFETs on the HV-side validate the feasibility and superior performance of the proposed converter.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a GaN Transistor based 90W ac/dc adapter with a Buck-PFC stage and an isolated Quasi-Switched-Capacitor (QSC) dc/dc stage. In the dc/dc stage, two different QSC converters are proposed. Compared to Flyback and LLC resonant converters, the QSC converters feature: 1) reduced voltage stress on the primary-side switches to 2/3 of the input voltage; 2) reduced voltage stress on the transformer to 1/3 of the input voltage and a lower transformer turns ratio; 3) a wide range for soft-switching operation and high efficiency; 4) a simple control strategy. The operation principles and simulation results are presented. A 90 W, 85 V/19 V, 1 MHz QSC resonant converter is built, using 100 V EPC eGaN FETs for all switches. This prototype achieves: 1) a high power density of 10.5 W/cm3; 2) wide-range soft switching and a peak efficiency of 92.8% at 900 kHz in preliminary test results. A Buck-PFC evaluation module from TI is tested with a GaN HEMT and a SiC Schottky diode. The peak efficiency reached 97.1%, and the experimental results are compared with those from the Si based version.},
