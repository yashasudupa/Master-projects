Real-Time Operating System - SS 2017

This is the template for the group directory. Copy this template into your repository, in such way that your structure looks like this:

Root
	RTOS_SS17_GroupXX
		apps
		middleware
		groupXX.txt
	RTOS_Public_SS17
		apps
		buildenv
		middleware
		
		
When you create a new app or middleware, keep the structure and copy the correspondent Makefiles. Note that Makefiles in different levels might be slightly different.
