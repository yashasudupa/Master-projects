/**
 * This function will be executed once at system start, right before the kernel invokes the scheduler for the first time.
 * 	It initializes the system timeline and the corresponding hardware timer:
 *
 * 	- At system start the OS timeline (os_timeline) has to start from 0.
 * 	- The OS timeline will be driven by the hardware TimerA0 which is in turn driven by the SMCLK:
 *		Use the function sysclk_getSMCLK() from sysclk.h to calculate suitable dividers for generating
 *		a timer frequency of 1MHz (resulting in a timeline resolution of 1us).
 *
 * 	Since the OS scheduler needs to be executed at certain points in time
 * 	(which basically depend on the task execution flow and the timer bit width)...
 * 	... the Timer is used in UpMode and CompareMode, using TA0CCR0 as hard overflow value.
 *  ... the Timer triggers an interrupt whenever it reaches the soft overflow value stored in TA0CCR1.
 *
 *	The function also makes sure that the TimerA Interrupt Enable and the general interrupts (use __EINT())
 *	bits are activated after the timer initialization.
 *
 *	The function also configures pin P6.0 as general purpose output pin, for test purposes
 *
 *	@return 1 on success (timer running at 1MHz),
 *			0 on failure (e.g., the target frequency of 1MHz could not be set)
